## Objectives <a id="MIM4:PersonalDataManagement-Goal"></a>

Sharing and reuse of personal data is increasingly important for cities in providing digital services to their citizens. Due to developments in AI and machine learning, there is an ongoing paradigm shift from reactive to proactive city, for example, serving citizens in a more personalized way in mobility cases where a route is calculated taking in account their preferences and needs. on top of that it is crucial that citizens are themselfs in control of their data.

Personal data needs to be shared across cities and regions. Citizens commute across cities, both national and globally, so there is a clear need for common standards to exchange personal data. 

Many of the personal data requirements are required by the law. For example, GDPR requires that the consent is always given for a specific purpose. On the other hand, if two laws are applicable for same data \(e.g., privacy and health care legislation\) which one rules? Specific consent helps to solve these conflicts.

There is a higher demand from citizens to know how, where and by who there data is used. This demand needs to be catered for in a very user friendly manner. There should be no wrong door to access your own personal data and an agreed standardized api and data model enable this.

## Capabilities <a id="MIM4:PersonalDataManagement-Capabilities"></a>

Citzens have clear choose on who and where their data is stored, and should be able to switch the data storage.

Citizens should be able to use the identity of their choosing, in best cases a keychain of identities can be defined, so that users can choose the identity per service.

Cities and regions are perfect candidates to provide personalised data services or to provide personal data to certified services.

Permission management of consent management needs to be handled preferably on attribute level.

Citizens should be able to roam with their data between cities and internationally.


## Specification <a id="MIM4:PersonalDataManagement-Recommendation"></a>

Today we see a number of initiativers around [MyData.org](https://www.mydata.org) and around the solid initiative of Tim-Berners lee.
