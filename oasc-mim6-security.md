## Objectives <a id="MIM1:ContextInformationManagement-Goal"></a>

As cities become smarter and more technology-driven, they become a target for cyber attacks with significant consequences in terms of costs and loss of services. All of these systems and data must be protected and projects should be implemented with security in mind.

Projects that are implemented by cities to offer digital services for citizens can be diverse and heterogeneous. In order to deliver reliable digital services for citizens, cities have to protect their systems and data. They have to continuously evaluate the cyber risks and to put in place security measures to prepare for cyber attacks. There is a need for an agreement on a methodology to help cities in the process of risk assessment and risk management.

The risk assessment identifies risks and help cities to choose the right security measures to protect their systems and data.
