# Resources for developers

On the link below you can find the evolving standards library for smart cities and communities.

[http://www.standards.city](http://www.standards.city)

It is a shared effort with input from many sources and Standards Developing Organisations \(SDOs\), originally collected in a mindmap by Lindsay Frost from NEC Labs Europe.

The library is work in progress, including the web interface, and you can contribute by sending updates and suggestions to [standards@oascities.org](mailto:standards@oascities.org).
