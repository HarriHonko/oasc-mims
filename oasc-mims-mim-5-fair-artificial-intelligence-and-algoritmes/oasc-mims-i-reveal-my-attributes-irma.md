The Privacy by Design Foundation in general aims to improve the development and the use of open, privacy-friendly and secure software.

More in particular, the foundation focuses on the development, roll out, and actual usage of its own system [IRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-en), an abbreviation of _I Reveal My Attributes_. With IRMA people can prove in a privacy-friendly and secure manner various personal properties \(attributes\) about themselves \(such as: Iâ€™m older than 18\), without revealing any other non-relevant information. Via such attributes you can _authenticate_ yourself, for instance in order to log into a webpage. In addition, IRMA allows its users to create attribute-based digital signature.

The Privacy by Design Foundation is chaired by [Bart Jacobs](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~bart). Bart is a full professor of computer security at Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. He works, together with his research group, on many societally relevant security and privacy topics, such as medical privacy, public transport travel cards, electronic voting.
